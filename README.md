This is a project part of The Odin Project!

#Added RubyGems(bootstrap4, simple_form, devise)

#Users can now Sign In, Log out and edit their accounts.

#Users can see their profile and what events they are attending

(!) Need to figure out:
  #letting users join and unjoin events
  #make event's date show how much time is left until the date rather than the date itself (eg: 6 days, 5 hours, 3 minutes instead of 2020/07/29 00:00:00 UTC)
